Testing The Rectangle Class:
-------------------------
Rectangle 1:
---------
Drawing a rectangle at x = 0 y = 0 with width = 10 and height = 5
Vertex 0 (-5, 2.5)
Vertex 1 (5, 2.5)
Vertex 2 (5, -2.5)
Vertex 3 (-5, -2.5)

Rectangle 2:
---------
Drawing a rectangle at x = 0 y = 0 with width = 10 and height = 5
Vertex 0 (-5, 2.5)
Vertex 1 (5, 2.5)
Vertex 2 (5, -2.5)
Vertex 3 (-5, -2.5)

Rectangle 3:
---------
Drawing a rectangle at x = 10 y = 10 with width = 10 and height = 10
Vertex 0 (5, 15)
Vertex 1 (15, 15)
Vertex 2 (15, 5)
Vertex 3 (5, 5)

Drawing a rectangle at x = 15 y = 15 with width = 10 and height = 10
Vertex 0 (10, 20)
Vertex 1 (20, 20)
Vertex 2 (20, 10)
Vertex 3 (10, 10)

Rectangle 4:
---------
Drawing a rectangle at x = 20 y = 20 with width = 12 and height = 4
Vertex 0 (14, 22)
Vertex 1 (26, 22)
Vertex 2 (26, 18)
Vertex 3 (14, 18)
