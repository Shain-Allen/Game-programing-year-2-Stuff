Testing Polymorphism:
----------------------
Drawing a circle at x = 10 y = 10 and radius 5

Drawing a rectangle at x = 30 y = 30 with width = 10 and height = 5
Vertex 0 (25, 32.5)
Vertex 1 (35, 32.5)
Vertex 2 (35, 27.5)
Vertex 3 (25, 27.5)

Drawing a polygon at x = 50 y = 50
Vertex 0 (55, 50)
Vertex 1 (50, 65)
Vertex 2 (45, 50)
